# What this is

Hi, I am Brad. I'm a tech consultant, Christian, and husband. I love the Bible and the study of the culture, history, and language found within it. While I am not a Bible scholar by any means, I do have a deep interest in the Bible and I'm always looking for new ways to learn more about it and grow in my faith in God. The purpose of this site is to share my thoughts and ideas about the Bible, God, and my relationship with God through Jesus with others. I focus on the Bible as a wholistic text and aim to understand everything within context of both the Old and New Testaments. I havae a passion for trying to answer the questions that can be a challenge. While I don't have every answer, I do think that God has equipped us with the tools to answer many quetions that the world, and beleivers, have asked for centuries if only we seek them out diligently and lean on the Holy Spirit for wisdom.

# What this isn't

This isn't a formal Bible study tool. I don't create Bible software and I am not licensed to teach in any capacity. This is one man's view of the Bible, world, and God. I am always seeking to grow and learn and encourage others to do the same. This site is not a replacement for your own learning, prayer, and expereinces. It is a place for me to process my thoughts, form opinions, and grow deeper in my faith.

## Aside

As I mentioned, I'm a tech consultant so this site doubles as a place for me to tinker and learn new ways to build websites. View my [resume](/resume) for more information about my background and experience or [contact me](/contact) if you have any questions or comments. If you find something weird, let me know and I will do my best to fix it. Any random tools yous stuble across, feel free to use. This site is open source and I welcome feedback.
