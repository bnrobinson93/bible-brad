# Known and Unknown

Have you ever wondered about God's plan for your life? The beautiful truth is that God wants to reveal His plan even more than we desire to know it. Throughout Scripture, we see this truth demonstrated repeatedly, giving us both comfort and direction.

One of the most reassuring aspects of God's will is that much of it is already clearly revealed in Scripture. In the Old Testament, God explicitly laid out His divine plan through specific instructions and prophecies about the Messiah. Even in the New Testament, we find clear guidance about God's will for our lives. As 1 Thessalonians 5:18 tells us, we should "give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus." Similarly, 1 Thessalonians 4:3-7 explicitly states that God's will is for us to be holy, specifically calling us to abstain from sexual immorality. 1 Peter 3:17 also states that "is better to suffer for doing good, **if God wills it**, than for doing evil," implying that God's will won't always result in a positive thing in this temporary world. God sometimes wills things that feel horrible, painful, or even like a punishment in the short term but his will is perfect and he always has the bigger picture in mind. Romans 12:2 calls us to live a life that is not of this world. We are to be renewed daily in our minds. This is what allows us to muster through the hard times.

There's often a tension between God's _known_ will and His _unknown_, sovereign plan for our individual lives. Many of us spend considerable time wondering about these unknown aspects of God's will: our future, our calling, our specific path. I would conjecture that the primary way to gain clarity about God's unknown will is to first be faithful in following His known will, specifically, obedience to the moral and spiritual instructions given to us. As we practice the known will of God, we can begin to see glimpses of how to handle the unkwown. For example, we learn in the Old Testament that we should repay anyone for something that was taken from them, even if it wasn't done by us directly but an animal for example. We can learn to live this out by paying to fix a window that our child breaks. God revealed his will to us in a small, earthly way and can apply it to our lives in a much broader way. Doing so answers questions that could be considered "unknown" insofar as the bible doesn't say anything about it. When you think about it, asking God about each and every decision and refusing to make any move without an answer seems silly. First, we should see if he's already revealed something similar to us so we don't have to ask the question to start with. To me, this is the entire point of the Old Testament: to show us how a righteous person lives, so that we can emulate it. The New Testament, then, shows that - with God - it is possible to actually live that righteous life.

Think of it this way: Choosing to ignore God's clear instructions while seeking guidance about the unknown is like being sent to the store with a shopping list. Instead of following the clear instructions you have, you spend hours wandering the aisles, calling home to ask if various unlisted items might be needed – all while the original list remains unfulfilled in your pocket. This perfectly illustrates how we often approach God's will, seeking answers about the unknown while neglecting the clearly stated. Rather, follow the list! When you do, you might notice the patterns within it, saving you the time and trouble of needing to ask. Let's say the list calls out eggs, flour, and sugar and you know that it's for a birthday cake. Do you need to ask whether you need butter? No, you already know the answer because you have first followed the list and know where you are within the process of making the cake. You need butter if you don't have any at home; if you already have some, you don't need it. You wouldn't need to call home to ask about it. So, too, is it with God. If we are in a circumstance where there's something "not on the list," but we have context, patterns, and a heavenly focus, God's plan is almost self-revealing.

So if I need to focus on the known will, how can we discern if we're walking in God's known will? There are several key indicators. First and foremost, salvation is at the core of God's will for humanity. As 2 Peter 3:9 reminds us, God "does not wish for any to perish but for all to come to repentance." Beyond this foundational aspect, God's will encompasses our daily conduct – calling us away from laziness and toward excellence in all we do (Colossians 3:17), guiding our romantic relationships toward godly partnerships (2 Corinthians 6:14), leading us to engage with a local church community (Hebrews 10:24-25), and compelling us to share the gospel (2 Timothy 4:5). Perhaps the hardest part of God's known will, something to check yourself on, is whether or not you forgive others and seek forgiveness from others. Forgiveness is a whole topic but I think _The Chosen_ summed it up nicely:

> **We do not apologize to receive forgiveness; we apologize to repent. Forgiveness is a gift the other person gives in response.**  
> Jesus, The Chose S4:E2

To help navigate God's will, both known and unknown, consider what can be called the "GPS" – God's Positioning System:

- **G** - go to God's word (Proverbs 3:5-6)
- **P** - pray for wisdom (James 1:5)
- **S** - seek wise counsel (Proverbs 15:22)

When facing decisions, ask yourself four essential questions:

1. Does this build my faith? (1 Corinthians 10:23)
   "Everything is lawful," but not everything is beneficial. "Everything is lawful," but not everything builds others up
2. Does this hurt my witness? (1 Corinthians 8:13, 1 Corinthians 10:24)

- For this reason, if food causes my brother or sister to sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I may not cause one of them to sin
- Do not seek your own good, but the good of the other person

3. Does this prevent me from sharing my faith? (1 Corinthians 10:33)
   Just as I also try to please everyone in all things. I do not seek my own benefit, but the benefit of many, so that they may be saved.
4. What most honors God? (1 Corinthians 10:31)
   So whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything for the glory of God

Remember, God's will isn't like finding a precise point in time and space that, once missed, is gone forever. It's more like using GPS navigation – if you miss a turn, there's always a way to recalibrate and get back on track. Rather than obsessing over finding the perfect seat in life's stadium, focus first on getting into the right section. When we align ourselves with God's known will, the unknown aspects often become clearer in His perfect timing.

The journey of discovering God's will isn't about perfect performance but faithful obedience. As we commit to following His revealed will in Scripture, we position ourselves to better understand His specific leading in our lives. Start with what you know, be faithful in the clear commands, and trust that God will guide you through the uncertainties.
